# ðŸŒ³ Part B: Multiple Inheritance
# 3.	Create a class Engine:
# o	Method: start() returns Engine started.

# o	Method: play() returns Playing music.
# 5.	Create a class Car that inherits from both Engine and MusicSystem:
# o	Method: drive() returns Car is driving.
# o	Test by creating an object of Car and invoking methods from both parent classes.
