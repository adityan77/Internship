# Simple Reflex Agent â€“ Vacuum Cleaner
# ðŸ”¹Objective:
# Simulate a simple reflex agent for a 1D or 2D vacuum cleaner world.

# ðŸ”¹Instructions:
# Create an environment as a list of rooms: e.g. ['Dirty', 'Clean', 'Dirty']

# Agent starts at position 0.

# If the current position is 'Dirty' â†’ clean it.

# Move to the next room and repeat.

# Stop when all rooms are clean.
